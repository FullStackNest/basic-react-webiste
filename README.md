### To get started:

- Step 1: `Download Zip File`
- Step 2: run `npm install` in the unzipped folder after extracting.
- Step 3: run `npm run start` in this case. As I had changed the `dev` to  `start`.

- Thanks Happy Coding :). 




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
